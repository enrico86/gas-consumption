  "body": "### The problem: consumption profile risk\r\nFor my [Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/) project I looked into the risks associated with selling natural gas, particularly to small, domestic consumers. This is vital for gas-selling companies (such as the one I work for), because as the energy commodity markets has become more and more liquid in recent years, margins related to gas reselling has been shrinking wildly. Small domestic consumers are the ones with larger margins, but also present the bigger risks in terms of consumption predictability.\r\n\r\nWHat I call _consumption price risk_ is essentially the following: suppose you sell a gas provision for a given temporal interval (let's say the whole year 2016) at a given price X. You buy the gas in advance in the forward market at a lower price and you may think that you locked in a margin. But the gas provision you can buy on the market is temporally \"flat\": a given amount of energy for every day of the year. Will your customer consume the same amount of gas every day? Let's look at [monthly consumption from U.S. residential use](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_cons_sum_a_EPG0_vrs_mmcf_m.htm)\r\n\r\n![](https://plot.ly/~enrico.tesio/10/domestic-us-gas-consumption/)\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
