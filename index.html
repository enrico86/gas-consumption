<p>For my <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/">Data Incubator</a> project I looked into the risks associated with selling natural gas, particularly to small, domestic consumers. This is vital for gas-selling companies (such as the one I work for), because as the energy commodity markets has become more and more liquid in recent years, margins related to gas reselling has been shrinking wildly. Small domestic consumers are the ones with larger margins, but also present the bigger risks in terms of consumption predictability.</p>

<p>What I call <em>consumption price risk</em> is essentially the following: suppose you sell a gas provision for a given temporal interval (let's say the whole year 2016) at a given price X. You buy the gas in advance in the forward market at a lower price and you may think that you locked in a margin. But the gas provision you can buy on the market is temporally "flat": a given amount of energy for every day of the year. Will your customer consume the same amount of gas every day? Let's look at <a href="https://plot.ly/%7Eenrico.tesio/10/domestic-us-gas-consumption/">monthly consumption from U.S. residential use</a></p>

<p>As can be seen from the graph, gas consumption is VERY seasonal dependent (winter is colder, summer is hotter after all), and not constant every month - let alone constant every day!</p>

<p>And what happens when a customer consumes more than you thought (or less?) You end up having an <em>imbalance</em> in your portfolio, i.e. either too much gas, that you need to sell on the spot market, or too less, which you will need to buy. Whether this will result in a loss or gain for the reseller, it all depends on the difference between the market price for the unbalanced volumes and the selling price. In an ideal world, you would always want to buy low and sell high, but unfortunately this is not the case. As in turns out, in fact, if consumption is higher than you expected it is likely that if will be so not only for your portfolio, but in general for everybody (e.g., temperatures are lower than expected), so that high demand on the market --&gt; higher prices. The converse is also true, i.e. if you are too <em>long</em> in your portfolio chances are that everybody else is long and trying to sell, lowering the price down. This effect is visible already at a macro-scale: correlation between U.S. residential consumption variations and the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm">Henry Hub</a> return is about 22% already on the <em>month</em> timescale (and increases as smaller scales)</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
